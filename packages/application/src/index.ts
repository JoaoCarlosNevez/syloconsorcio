// Application layer — use cases and orchestration.
//
// Allowed dependencies: @sylocrm/domain only.
// Must NOT depend on: Infrastructure, Supabase, Drizzle, React, HTTP frameworks.
// Verified by architecture tests in packages/testing/src/arch/application.test.ts.
//
// Use cases are added here as product features are implemented.
// Each use case receives repository interfaces (ports) from Domain via dependency injection.
